===========

Psichiatric is a set of Sage worksheets providing implementations of

* Psi-class intersection calculations on Deligne--Mumford spaces using Mirzakhanis recursion relation, see `Mirzakhani Psi Intersection`_,
* Weil-Peterson volume calculations using Mirzakhanis recursion relations, see `Mirzakhani WP Volume`_ and `McShane Identity`_ for the first result in this direction,
* Hurwitz number calculations based on the combinatorial representation, see e.g. `Hurwitz Number`_ and
* some combinatorial calculations relating the above concepts as described in the authors PhD thesis, see `Pruefer PhD`_.

Older versions of this code were used in the mentioned thesis.

Note that the code at the moment is in a somewhat simple state and might not be usable. The goal is to improve this, somehow make a package out of it and then make it usable in Sage.
